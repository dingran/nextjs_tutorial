# Next.js Tutorial Guide

This guide provides a structured learning path for Next.js (v15+), focusing on modern features and best practices. The tutorial is designed for developers with basic React.js knowledge who want to learn Next.js and its latest features including Server Components, App Router, and more.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Familiarity with React.js fundamentals
- Node.js installed on your system
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)

## Course Structure

We'll build a practical Todo application that demonstrates key Next.js concepts while progressively introducing new features.

### 1. Fundamentals and Setup
- Project initialization and folder structure
- Understanding the App Router architecture
- Basic routing concepts
  - File-based routing
  - Nested routes
  - Dynamic routes
- Creating pages and layouts
- Navigation between pages

### 2. React Server Components (RSC) and Client Components
- Server Components vs Client Components
- When to use each type
- Component patterns and best practices
- Understanding the "use client" directive
- State management in the Server Components era
- Component composition strategies

### 3. Data Fetching and Caching
- Server-side data fetching patterns
- Static Site Generation (SSG)
- Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
- Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
- Caching strategies
  - Full Route Cache
  - Router Cache
  - Data Cache
- Request memoization
- Data revalidation strategies

### 4. Forms and Mutations
- Server Actions (new form handling)
  - Form validation

  - Optimistic updates
- Client-side form handling
- File uploads
- Real-time validation
- Progress indicators and loading states

### 5. Styling and UI
- CSS Modules
- Tailwind CSS integration
- CSS-in-JS solutions
- Component libraries

  - Role-based access
- API Routes
  - REST endpoints
  - API middleware
  - Error handling
- Middleware implementation
- Image optimization
- Environment variables
- Error boundaries
- Loading states
- Performance optimization

## Project: Todo Application

Throughout this tutorial, we'll build a feature-rich Todo application that demonstrates these concepts in practice. The application will include:

1. User authentication
2. CRUD operations for todos
3. Real-time updates
4. Categories and filtering
5. Due dates and reminders
6. Responsive design
7. Dark/Light mode
8. Performance optimizations

## Getting Started

Each section will build upon the previous ones, with working commits at each stage. This allows you to follow along step by step or jump to specific sections of interest.
