# Section 1: Fundamentals and Setup

## Overview
This section covers the foundational aspects of Next.js, including project setup and basic routing concepts.

## Learning Objectives
- Understanding Next.js project structure
- Learning the App Router architecture
- Creating and organizing routes
- Working with layouts and pages
- Implementing navigation

## Project Implementation
We'll start building our Todo application by:
1. Setting up a new Next.js project with TypeScript
2. Configuring Tailwind CSS for styling
3. Creating the basic folder structure
4. Implementing the main layout
5. Creating our first pages

## Key Concepts
- File-based routing
